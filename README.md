# C++ Tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains code that demonstrates the basic functionality of the `C++` programming language. `C++` is one of the most important programming languages today and software at all levels (low-level software for device drivers & firmware, operating systems, as well as user-level programs like Adobe Photoshop and video games, [see here](http://www.stroustrup.com/applications.html) for a more extensive list) is written in C++. Nevertheless, C++ is a complex language with many features and standards, and it is hard to find good introductory texts on C++. Thus, I started to summarize the most useful resources that I came across will trying to learn C++. Hopefully, the code and text files (mostly small tutorials that demonstrate certain language features) in this repository are helpful for others who are just getting started with C++.
