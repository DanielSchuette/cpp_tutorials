# C++ Tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains code that demonstrates the basic functionality of the `C++` programming language. `C++` is one of the most important programming languages today and software products at all levels (low-level software for device drivers & firmware, operating systems, as well as user-level programs like Adobe Photoshop and video games, [see here](http://www.stroustrup.com/applications.html) for a more extensive list) are written in `C++`. 

Nevertheless, `C++` is a complex language with many features, best practices, and standards, and it is hard to find good introductory texts related to `C++` (on the internet; Bjarne Stroustrup, the original implementor of `C++` wrote a collection of [books](http://www.stroustrup.com/books.html) that provide an extensive overview of the language). Thus, I started to summarize the most useful resources that I came across will trying to learn `C++`. This repository is mostly meant to be a reference for myself. But maybe the code and text files (mostly small tutorials that demonstrate certain language features) in this repository are helpful for others who are just getting started with `C++`. Ultimately, the language specification and Bjarne Stroustrup's books are the go-to `C++` references, of course.
