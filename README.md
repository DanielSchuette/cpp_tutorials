# C++ Tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains code that demonstrates the basic functionality of the C++ programming language. C++ is one of the (maybe the) most important programming languages today and software at all levels (device drivers & firmware, operating systems, and programs) is written in C++. Nevertheless, C++ is a complex language with many features and standards, and it is hard to find good introductory texts on C++. Thus, I started to summarize the most useful resources that I came across will trying to learn C++. Hopefully, the code and text files (mostly small tutorials that demonstrate certain language features) in this repository are helpful for others who are just getting started with C++.
