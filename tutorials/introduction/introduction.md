# Introduction

## What is C++?

`C++` is a powerful general-purpose programming language. That means that `C++` can be used (and in fact **IS** used) for a variety of programming tasks. `C++` is utilized for low-level systems programming like the implementation of device drivers and operation systems as well as command line applications and applications with a graphical user interface (*GUI*). Last but not least, `C++` is used as the backend of most modern, high-performance web servers (**REFERENCE HERE**).

`C++` supports a wide range of so-called *programming paradigm*. *Programming paradigms* are certain ways to write and organize code. The following paradigms are part of C++ and we will implement all of them along the way:

1. Object-oriented programming (OOP), using
    * Objects and classes
    * Encapsulation
    * Inheritance
    * Polymorphism
2. Procedural programming
3. Generic programming
4. Functional programming

Furthermore, `C++` is 

5. Statically typed

and

6. Compiled

In the next section, we will see what that means and how we can set up a working C++ programming environment. Before we do that though, we will take a look at the history of C++, a few more use cases of the language, and which components constitute it. We will also see that multiple standards exist and which problems that might cause.
