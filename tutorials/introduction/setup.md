# Setup a Programming Environment

## Overview

`C++` is a compiled programming language. That means, a so-called `compiler` is required to convert `C++` source code into runnable programs. Many different `C++` exist and they reflect the evolution of the language itself, i.e. not all compilers support the latest `C++` standards or implement them in different ways. Bjarne Stroustrup list a variety of common compilers on his [website](http://www.stroustrup.com/compilers.html), though. The major compiler vendors all support the latest `C++` language features and many of them are available for free and/or open-sourced. To follow along, it is recommended that you install an up-to-date `C++` compiler and a text editor that supports syntax highlighting for `C++`. The latter is not striktly required, though (instead, you could write `C++` source code using the terminal-based editor [Vim]() that is pre-installed on all Unix-based operating systems or [Notepad]() on Windows). 

Examples of such editors are [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/). They are often called IDEs (Integrated Development environments), because they provide many more features in addition to syntax highlighting, e.g. linting (tools that flag potential stylistic or syntax errors on the fly) and code completion. Search the internet for more information on how to set up an IDE for writing `C++` programs!

## What Does a Compiler Do?

There are two fundamentally different types of programming languages, interpreted (or scripting) languages like `Python` ... and compiled languages like `C`/`C++` or `Go`.
